In this problem, I used the rand() function to generate random numbers for interarrival time.Then I used the rule to find arrival time of a customer is (interArrialTime[i]+arrivalTime[i-1].
By generating the random value using rand90 funtion, at first I generated interarrival time. And then by applying the formula, I found out the arrival time.
